# Shellcode
An assembly and C shellcode that is recieved as data in a victim and by using a vulnerability to activate it sets up a message box.

How does it work? I wrote it first in C, as you can see in the file sellcode_c_part. I then compiled it and opened the .exe file in IDA. I used my RE skills to find the necesery parts and than created a new assembly file with the neede code. After adjusting the code to work without globals (creating my own "data section" with Lablels before every needed string) and imports(Accessing the PEB of the victim process, finding its image base, going through its PE format, finding the functions LoadLibraryA() and GetProcAddress() that allows me to load the User32.dll and import the MessageBoxW() function from it), I tested and debugged it by compiling the ASM file, grabbing the necessary parts using 010editor, creating a new binary file with this data and testing it on the victim. the victim I tested it on is an udeak victim I wrote, that reads the shellcode given as a binary file, allocate space for the data and save it in the memmory and finally jumping to it and letting it run. Even though it was tested on an ideal victim, it was also checked on a C server in which I've found a stack overflow vulnerability that allows me to override the return address of the function and replace it with a pointer to my shellcode.
